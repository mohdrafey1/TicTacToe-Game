# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe! This project is a simple web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. This README file will provide an overview of the project, instructions on how to play the game, and details on how to contribute to the project.

## How to Play

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking empty cells with their respective symbols (usually 'X' and 'O').

The game follows these rules:
- Player 1 (X) starts the game.
- Players take turns marking empty cells on the board.
- The game continues until one player has three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or until the board is full (resulting in a draw).

## Controls

- Click on an empty cell to place your symbol ('X' or 'O').
- The game will automatically switch turns between Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O).

## Tech Stack

- **HTML:** Structure of the web page.
- **CSS:** Styling and layout of the web page.
- **JavaScript:** Game logic and interactivity.
